<h3>A PLEA FOR PLEADINGS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;Last week
I begged for a chance for the
Briefless, and the only reply has
been, that by a few strokes of
the pen the Judges have ruined
and undone the Junior Bar. On
a day which will be known
henceforth in the Temple as
Bad Friday, we read the new
Rules, by which in future it will
be possible to have an action&mdash;<i>without
pleadings!</i> Statement
of Claim, Defence, Reply, Rejoinder&mdash;all
disappear into a
beggarly "Summons for Directions,"
that can be drawn by a
solicitor's office-boy. Of course,
amongst the silks, the change
will, no doubt, be popular. These
learned gentlemen can with a
light heart and a heavy pocket
welcome the change, which will
get rid of the pleadings which
it is merely a nuisance to read.
But what is to become of us
whose business it is to draw
them?</p>

<p>It may possibly be said that
this new arrangement will save
the pockets of the clients, but
what have the Judges to do with
that? Does anyone imagine
litigation to be anything more
than a pastime, at which those
who play ought to be content to
pay? In a hard winter, when
the wolf is consistently at our
door, to take the bread out of
our mouths in this way, is a proceeding
which (<i>pace</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>)
takes the cake. I am
sure Mr. <span class="sc">Goschen</span> will welcome
such an expression. In any case
I appeal, Sir, through you, from
the Judges to an enlightened
paying public.</p>

<p class="author1a">Yours faithfully,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">L. Erned Counsel</span>.</p>

<h3>"VARIETY! VA-RI-E-TY!"</h3>

<p  class="ind">"The Kilanyi Troupe" at the Palace Theatre of Varieties, with
their strikingly realistic <i>Tableaux Vivants</i>, might well change their
name <i>pro tem.</i> to "The Kill-any-other Troupe" that might be
venturing in the same line. Of course, they are a great attraction,
and would be still greater, were the Show varied from night to
night, altogether omitting No. 6 in the present programme, and, in
view of the popularity of "A tale of the tide," the humour of which
is perceptible to everyone on account of the waggery in the tail, by
substituting two or three comic for the simply classic <i>poses</i>. Mr.
<span class="sc">Charles Morton</span>, trading on his acquired store of operatic knowledge,
might give us a statuette of <i>Les Deux Gendarmes</i>, who
could just vary their attitudes according to the movement of <span class="sc">Offenbach's</span>
celebrated duett. After a short interval of patriotic song
about <span class="sc">Nelson</span> and "doing duty" there is a capital French clown,
or clown of some nationality, whose fun is genuine, and whose
imitations, animal and orchestral, are excellent and really amusing.
This is a case in which, if a real bassoon or a real hen intruded
itself, either would be hissed, and the false honestly preferred to the
real. Altogether, except that the ballet which plays the people
out, and does play them out effectually, is old-fashioned, it is an
excellent evening's entertainment. The County Council ought to
come in their thousands, and, like the little dog who was so pleased
to see the cow jumping over the moon, they would "laugh to see
such sport."</p>

<h2 class="sans">UNDER THE ROSE.</h2>

<h4>(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span> XIX.&mdash;<i>The Drawing-room.</i> Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> <i>is still regarding</i>
Mr. <span class="sc">Jannaway</span>, <i>after the manner of an elderly bird in the
presence of a young and somewhat inexperienced serpent</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toovey</i> (<i>coming to the rescue</i>). Excuse me, young Sir, but I
don't think you quite realise who that lady <i>is</i>. (<i>With mild self-assertion.</i>)
She is my wife, Sir, my Wife! And she is not
<i>accustomed</i> to being hunted all over Upper Tooting, or anywhere
else!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jannaway</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I've got this dear lady on toast. <i>I</i> can
see! But I mustn't do anything ungentlemanly or I may get the
sack if the governor gets to hear of it. (<i>Aloud.</i>) If I'm mistaken
I'm ready to apologise; but the lady bears such a really
remarkable likeness to a Mrs. <span class="sc">Tomkinson Jones</span>, residing (so she
gave me to understand) at The Laburnums, Upper Tooting,
that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toovey</i> (<i>finding her voice</i>). I do <i>not</i> reside at Upper
Tooting!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jann.</i> (<i>in silky tones</i>). Precisely
<i>so</i>, Madam. No more does
Mrs.&mdash;hem&mdash;<span class="sc">Tomkinson Jones</span>!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> And is <i>that</i> the only
point of resemblance between your
friend Mrs. <span class="sc">Jones</span> and my Aunt,
eh?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jann.</i> That's a matter of
opinion, Sir. I've my own. But
neither the lady nor yet myself
are particularly likely to forget
our meeting. It was only last
Saturday evening, too!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Why, then you must
have met Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> at the
Zenana Mission Conference?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jann.</i> Well that isn't the
name <i>I</i> know it by; but if the
lady prefers it, why&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>hoarsely</i>). I&mdash;I deny
having ever met the young man
before, anywhere; that is, I&mdash;I
don't remember doing so. Take
him away!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jann.</i> I should be most
averse, of course, to contradicting
a lady, and I can only conclude
that she is so much in the 'abit of
fetching unoffending strangers
what I may venture to term, if
you'll permit the vulgarity, a slap
in the jaw, that such a trifling
circumstance makes no impression
on her. It did on <i>me</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>outraged</i>). Young
man! are you endeavouring to
suggest that my wife goes about&mdash;er&mdash;administering
"slaps in the
jaw" to perfect strangers at Zenana
meetings?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jann.</i> Pardon me, I said
nothing whatever about any&mdash;er&mdash;Pyjama
meetings. I don't know
what may go on <i>there</i>, I'm sure.
The incident <i>I</i> alluded to occurred at the Eldorado music-hall.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). There; it's out at last! What <i>have</i> I
done to deserve this?</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>to himself</i>). The Eldorado! Why, <span class="sc">Thea</span> <i>said</i>&mdash;&mdash;What
<i>can</i> Aunt have been up to? She's got herself into the very deuce of
a hole!</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<span class="sc">Curphew</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Althea</span> <i>exchange significant glances</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> At the Eldorado? Now, do you know that's very singular&mdash;that
really is very singular indeed! You're the <i>second</i>
person who fancied Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> was there last Saturday evening!
So that you see there <i>must</i> have been a lady there most extraordinarily
like my wife!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Dear, good, simple Pa; <i>he</i> believes in me!
After all, I've only to deny everything; he can't <i>prove</i> I was there!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Yes, Sir, and on a mere resemblance like that you have
the audacity to bring these shameful charges against me&mdash;<i>me</i>! All
you have succeeded in establishing is that you were in the music-hall
yourself, and I doubt whether your employer would approve of
a clerk of his spending his time in such places, if it came to his ears!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jann.</i> It's very kind of you to concern yourself on my
account, Madam; but there's no occasion. It was Mr. <span class="sc">Larkins</span>
himself gave me the ticket; so I'm not at all uneasy.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 340px;"><a href="images/280-800.png"><img src="images/280-340.png" width="340" height="482" alt="'Why, Cornelia, my love, so you've found your spectacles!'" /></a>
<p class="center">"Why, Cornelia, my love, so you've <i>found</i> your spectacles!"</p></div>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Why, dear me, that must have been the ticket Mr.
<span class="sc">Curphew</span>&mdash;I should say, Mr. <span class="sc">Walter Wildfire</span>&mdash;sent me. I
remember I left it with Mr. <span class="sc">Larkins</span> in case he could find a use for
it. So you were in <i>my</i> box; quite a coincidence, really!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jann.</i> As you say, Sir, and not the only one neither, seeing
that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Pa, isn't it time this young man finished the business
he came about, and went away? I am not accustomed to seeing my
drawing-room made use of as an office!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>snatching up the transfer</i>). By all means, my love. (<i>To</i>
Mr. J.) Er, I really think we should be more comfortable in the
study. There&mdash;there's a bigger inkstand.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>He leads the way to the door.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Jann.</i> (<i>following</i>). As <i>you</i> please, Sir. (<i>Turning at the door.</i>)
I must say I think I've been most cruelly misunderstood. If I've
been anxious for the pleasure of meeting Mrs. <span class="sc">Tomkinson Jones</span>
again, any revengeful motives or lowness of that description was
far from my thoughts, my sole object being to restore a piece of
property which the lady, whoever she may have been, left behind
her, and which, as I 'appen to have brought it with me, would, if
recognised, settle any question of
identity on the spot. But that
can wait for the present. Business
first, pleasure afterwards!</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>He goes out. A silence. Presently
a succession of violent sniffs proceed
from behind "The Quiver."
All rise in concern.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Charles.</i> I say, Aunt, you're not
going to give way <i>now</i>, are you?
That fellow hasn't frightened you?</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>kneeling down and embracing</i>
Mrs. T.). Dearest mamma,
<i>don't</i> you think you'd better tell
us all about it? It was <i>you</i> who
slapped that horrid little man's
face&mdash;now, <i>wasn't</i> it? And serve
him right!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> (<i>in a burst</i>). I took him
for your father! Oh, what have I
<i>said</i>? I never meant to admit
anything! And what must you all
think of me?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> No one who has had the
benefit of your opinions of music-halls
or their entertainers, can possibly
imagine you went to one
with any idea of <i>amusing</i> yourself,
Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>without heeding
him</i>). And Pa, what will <i>he</i> say?
When I think of all the wicked
stories I've had to tell that poor
dear man! And after he once finds
them out, there's an end of all his
respect for me, all my influence
over him, all my power in this
house&mdash;<i>everything</i>! Why, for anything
<i>I</i> can tell, Pa may actually
believe I went to that detestable
place on what (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Curphew</span>) I
suppose your friends would call
the&mdash;the (<i>utterly breaking down</i>)
Tee-hiddle-dy-hi!</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>after a highly suspicious
fit of choking</i>). Don't think there's any danger of that, Aunt;
but look here, how if I went into the study and kicked that little
cad out, eh?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> And have the whole affair in the police reports!
<i>You</i>'re a pretty solicitor, <span class="sc">Charles</span>! But Pa <i>knows</i> by now, and
oh, what in the <i>world</i> am I to do?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Well, my dear Aunt, it sounds an immoral suggestion,
but, as you seem to have given Uncle a&mdash;hem&mdash;slightly picturesque
version of your doings last Saturday, hadn't you better <i>stick</i> to it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> What's the use? Didn't you hear that wretch say
he'd found something in the box? It's my spectacles, <span class="sc">Charles</span>; a
pair in a Rob Roy tartan case, which Pa gave me himself, and
couldn't <i>help</i> recognising! I remember now, I left them there,
and&mdash;&mdash;(<i>The door opens.</i>) They're coming back!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>entering</i>). That's really a very honest young fellow,
my love, nothing will satisfy him but bringing in the article he's
found, and seeing whether it belongs to you or not.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>breathlessly</i>). And have <i>you</i> seen it, Pa&mdash;have you
<i>seen</i> it?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Not yet, dear love, not yet. He's getting it out of his
great coat in the hall.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>starting up from behind</i> <span class="sc">Althea</span>). I think, if you will
allow me, <i>I</i>'ll go and speak to him first. It strikes me that I may
know the lady who was in that box, and I'm naturally anxious to
avoid any&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">End of Scene XIX.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Scene XX.</span>&mdash;<i>A few minutes later.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself, in a fever</i>). Why doesn't he come back?
What are those two plotting together? Oh, if Mr. <span class="sc">Wildfire</span>
imagines he will get a hold over me, so as to obtain my consent
to&mdash;&mdash; I'd sooner tell Pa everything! (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Curphew</span>, <i>who reenters,
smiling</i>.) W&mdash;where is&mdash;the other?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> The other? Oh, <i>he</i>'s gone. I made myself known to
him; and you would have been surprised, my dear Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>,
at the immense effect my professional name had upon him. When
he realised I was <span class="sc">Walter Wildfire</span> he was willing to do anything
for me, and so I easily got him to entrust his find to me.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>inquisitively</i>). And what is it&mdash;a fan, or a glove?
There would be no harm in showing it to <i>us</i>, eh?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> Well, really, it's so very unlikely to compromise anybody
that I almost think I <i>might</i>. Yes, there can't be any
objection.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>He takes something out of his pocket, and presents it to</i> Mr. T.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>mystified</i>). Why, it's only a hairpin! What a
scrupulously honest young man that is, to be sure!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>relieved</i>). Only a hairpin? (<i>Then, uneasily, to</i>
<span class="sc">Curph.</span>, <i>in an undertone</i>.) Where is&mdash;you know what? Have you
kept it to use for your own advantage?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>in the same tone</i>). I am a very bad man, I know; but
I don't blackmail. You will find it behind the card-basket in the
hall.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[Mrs. T. <i>goes out</i>; <span class="sc">Alth.</span> <i>draws</i> <span class="sc">Curph.</span> <i>aside</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Alth.</i> <span class="sc">Clarence</span>, I&mdash;I <i>must</i> know; how did you come to have a&mdash;a
hairpin? where did it come <i>from</i>? (<i>As he softly touches the back
of her head.</i>) Oh! it was <i>mine</i>, then? <i>What</i> a goose I am?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>as</i> Mrs. T. <i>returns</i>). Why, <span class="sc">Cornelia</span>, my love, so
you've <i>found</i> your spectacles! Now where did you leave them
<i>this</i> time, my dear, eh?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Where I shall not leave them <i>again</i> in a hurry,
<span class="sc">Theophilus</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Don't you be too sure of that, my love. By the way,
Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>, that lady of your acquaintance&mdash;<i>you</i> know, the one
who made all this disturbance at the Eldorado&mdash;is she at all <i>like</i>
Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>, now?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> (<i>after reflection</i>). Well, really, there <i>is</i> a resemblance&mdash;at
a distance!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>peevishly</i>). Then it's annoying&mdash;very annoying;
because it might compromise my poor dear wife, you know. I&mdash;I
wish you could give her a quiet hint to&mdash;to avoid such places in
future!</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> Do you know, Sir, I really think it will be <i>quite</i>
unnecessary.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span> <i>enters to announce dinner</i>.

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Dinner, eh? Yes, yes, dinner, to be sure. Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>,
will you take in my dau&mdash;&mdash;(<i>correcting himself</i>)&mdash;oh, but, dear me,
I was quite forgetting that&mdash;h'm!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> &mdash;&mdash;that Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> has been expressing an ardent impatience
to close your doors on me for ever?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>not over graciously</i>). That was before&mdash;&mdash; I mean
that&mdash;considering the manner in which we all of us seem to have
been more or less mixed up with the music-hall of late&mdash;we can't
afford to be too particular. If Mr. <span class="sc">Wildfire</span> chooses to stay, he
will find as warm a welcome as&mdash;(<i>with a gulp</i>)&mdash;he can <i>expect</i>!</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> Many thanks, but I'm sure you see that I can't stay here

<p class="ind1">Yes, but I did not want to talk about that. You know there's
been more outrages in Dublin? They have spread from Paris.</p>

<p class="ind1">Have they? Get some Johnnie on the spot to look after them.</p>

<p class="ind1">But I told the House that although you were in the South of
France, you were in telegraphic touch with your colleagues.</p>

<p class="ind1">What did you do that for? My doctor will be awfully angry.</p>

<p class="ind1">I dare say. But what are you going to do about this dynamite scare?</p>

<p class="ind1">Leave it to <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>; he's equal to anything and everybody.</p>

<p class="ind1">Yes, as a rule; but not just now. He's on leave. Bad cold.</p>

<p class="ind1">Well, let <span class="sc">Asquith</span> have a shot. He is a rising young man.</p>

<p class="ind1">But he's away, too; and so is <span class="sc">Harcourt</span>, <span class="sc">Spencer</span>, <span class="sc">Ripon</span>, and
the others. They all say they can do nothing further.</p>

<p class="ind1">Sorry. Can I help it? Impossible to govern Ireland from Monte
Carlo.</p>

<p class="ind1">Not if you give your mind to it. But, of course, if you will go in
for systems, you haven't much chance.</p>

<p class="ind1">Well, frankly, I can't manage it. You must get some one else.</p>

<p class="ind1">Sorry I can't.</p>

<p class="ind1">Then what will you do?</p>

<p class="ind1">Why, manage it myself. After all, if I have twice the years of
you fellows I have four times the energy. As I am doing all
the other work of the Ministry, I may as well make a complete job
of it. I will do it myself!</p>

<p>"The ever-advancing
<i>Woman</i>," observes one of
the Baronesses, "has quite
come forward this Christmas,
daintily attired."
Wonderful money-prizes
are to be won by the lucky
person who guesses the
author of "Bid Me not
Go," which is the Christmas
story of the enterprising
<i>Gentlewoman</i>.</p>

<p>"As for Christmas Cards
being Christmassy," quoth
a young Baron brusquely,
"why it's all <span class="sc">Walker</span>!"
The Baron was about to
rebuke the scion of his
noble house, but discovered,
on application, that the
youth had been alluding
to the Christmas Card publisher
of that name, whose
designs are not peculiarly
Christmassy, but what the
Baroness terms "so dainty!"</p>

<p><span class="sc">S. Hildesheimer</span> &amp; Co.'s clever and amusing Christmas Cards
will be much appreciated by young people.</p>

<p>Three books full of stories, to suit all ages. <span class="sc">Hutchinson's</span> House.
<i>Fifty-two Stories for Children</i>, <i>Fifty-two Stories for Girlhood and
Youth</i>, and <i>Fifty-two Stories for Boyhood and Youth</i>. Just a story
a week, will last the year. Collected by <span class="sc">Alfred H. Miles</span>. You
won't find a better if you go for Miles.</p>

<p><i>Valdmer, the Viking</i>, by <span class="sc">Hume Nisbet</span>, was a wonderful Dane,
who, after invading England in the Tenth Century, took a trip
from Thanet (having invented Ramsgate and Margate) all round
America, and thought nothing of it. Those who read this will
probably think something of it.</p>

<p><i>The Hoyden</i>, written by Mrs. <span class="sc">Hungerford</span>, and published by
<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>, is the story of a rather frivolous nineteenth-century
tomboy; "but," quoth the Baroness, "though it does not come
within measurable distance of <i>The O'Connors of Ballinahinch</i>, it is
pleasant light reading."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Gladstone's Life; Told by Himself</i>, is an alluring title,
which, in spite of the volume being issued by so respectable a house
as <span class="sc">Kegan Paul's</span>, savours of a flam. But it is genuine enough.
Every word in the little volume has been spoken or written by
Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>. Mr. <span class="sc">Leech</span>, whilst modestly disclaiming any
imposition of responsibility upon the <span class="sc">Premier</span>, has ingeniously linked
passages from speeches or letters published under his name during
the past sixty years. The result is a really fascinating work.
Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> has always been prone to drop into autobiography.
Nothing, my Baronite tells me, was more delightful than the
speeches he used to deliver in the House of Commons on Friday and
Tuesday nights. Some chance reference to <span class="sc">Canning</span>, <span class="sc">Peel</span>, or <span class="sc">Palmerston</span>
brought up a flood of recollections, and Mr. G. used to chat of
old times with the entranced House.</p>

<p>In a pleasant little book called <i>Essays on Idleness</i>, the authoress,
<span class="sc">Agnes Repplier</span>, speaking of her cat, observes, "It were ignoble to
wish myself in her place, and yet how charming to be able to settle
down to a nap, <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>, at ten o'clock in the
morning." Surely instead of "<i>sans peur</i>" she should have written
"<i>sans purr</i>," as far more applicable to a cat asleep.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Here</span> is a work that I prize indeed!" quoth the Baron, surveying
with unmixed pleasure two handsome volumes, readable from
every point of view of type, handiness, and matter that is of
substance and spirit, being a re-issue of the immortal <i>Autocrat of
the Breakfast Table</i>, by <span class="sc">Oliver Wendell Holmes</span>. "Mind you,"
he continues, tenderly regarding them, "though this I admit is an
<i>édition de luxe</i>, yet do I far and away prefer the simple volume
without illustrations. Why illustrations? Why try to impose on
us, as by artistic authority, the faces, forms, and the situations that
we would infinitely prefer to idealise? Without the faculty of
imagination no one can enjoy this work, pictures or no pictures:
possessed of the faculty, what need of the illustrations, save so far
as they may carry out our own notions of the author's meaning? If
they do not, then we quarrel with them. But many thanks for
these two volumes, brought out by Messrs. <span class="sc">Gay and Bird</span> (delightful
association of adjective and substantive, as we have had afortime
occasion to remark); for among all hooks, whether at this Christmas
Season, when they come in quite with a Charles-Lamblike and
Washington-Irvingesque flavour, or at any other time, these be
most welcome to the constant lover of old Literary Friends.</p>

<h3>A GAME OF CHANCE.</h3>

<h4>(<i>From an Imaginative
French Source.</i>)</h4>

<p>War had broken out between
France and Great
Britain. In the Mediterranean&mdash;owing
to several
French ironclads having
got through into the Black
Sea and being unable to
get out again&mdash;the French
fleet was shut up in Toulon
harbour by a powerful
English squadron. It was
just at this time that some
curious events were taking
place in the neighbouring
seaside resort of Sablettes-les-Bains,
recently purchased
by an English company,
which was running
the place as a kind of compromise
between Boulogne
and Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>"<i>Messieurs, faites vos
jeux!</i>"&mdash;was heard the
monotonous refrain of the
burly "Croupier," who, with face rather pale, and a preoccupied
air, was presiding over one of the numerous games of "<i>Petits-Chevaux</i>,"
combined with "<i>Rouge et Noir</i>" which were proceeding
in the gorgeously-upholstered and magnificently-lighted "<i>Salle des
Papas Perdus</i>" of the "<i>Cercle des Etrangers</i>" of this Paradise of
the Middle Sea.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Croupier sprang from his seat, threw off his loose
outer coat, and displayed the well-known uniform of an Officer in
Her Majesty's Royal Shropshire Yeomanry Carabineers. All the
other Croupiers did the same. Astonishment and dismay were
depicted on the countenances of the players.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the Croupier, "I am sorry to say you are all
my prisoners. Resist, and you will be shot without mercy!"</p>

<p>"But I had just staked twenty thousand Louis on the black!"
ejaculated a bewildered Gaul.</p>

<p>"You have lost your stake, Monsieur," replied the Croupier,
with politeness. "It is red, not black;" and, in a moment, all the
English visitors who thronged the rooms had also thrown off <i>their</i>
overcoats, and the hall was filled with red-coats.</p>

<p>"Treachery! <i>Perfide Alb</i>&mdash;&mdash;" the Gaul shouted; but ere he
could rise from his seat to give the alarm to the Toulon garrison, as
he had fully intended doing, a hundred swords (made in Birmingham)
had passed simultaneously through his body. Their stakes
fell from the trembling hands of the players.</p>

<p>"Then are we to understand," asked another Frenchman, who
had somewhat recovered from the first shock of surprise, "that the
English Government has suppressed Sablettes-les-Bains because it
disapproves of the game of <i>Petits-Chevaux</i>?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied the Croupier-Officer. "It is a military
<i>coup-de-main</i>, that's all. The English company running this place,
was, of course, in the pay of the British War Office. By a prearranged
system of signals we have been making known everything
that is going on at Toulon to the British Admiral out at sea. You
may perhaps have noticed what an extremely large orchestra took
part in last night's free classical concert; they were English marines
disguised as musicians. And the gardens attached to the Casino,
which rival those of Monte Carlo, what do you think those grassy
slopes crowned with olives and orange-trees are in reality? Why,
the artfully-contrived glacis of the impregnable fortress inside
which you are now standing, and which I have the honour to
command!"</p>

<p>Just then the booming of cannon was heard outside.</p>

<p>"It is our guns playing on the defences of Toulon!" exclaimed
the Officer. "Toulon is ours!"</p>

<p>And the treacherous Britons, having cleared the tables of the
five-franc pieces still remaining on them, proceeded, with the aid of
the Germans and Italians, to the dismemberment of France.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday evening, December 4.</i>&mdash;Slight coolness
sprung up between Major <span class="sc">Rasch</span> and Members in immediate neighbourhood.
<span class="sc">Stanley Leighton</span> observed an insect of unfamiliar
appearance disporting itself on the Major's back. Closer inspection
revealed presence of others, one carefully pricking its way through
his bristling hair. In these days, when microbes are a little too
familiar in their habit, this curious phenomenon led to some uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Major <span class="sc">Rasch</span>, when his attention was delicately
called to matter; "some of 'em must have got out. Only locusts,
dear boy; needn't be frightened; put down question to <span class="sc">Herbert
Gardner</span> as to importation of Russian hay which is swarming with
locusts. <span class="sc">Grand Young Gardner</span> absent; engaged in cultivating
the influenza microbe; <span class="sc">Herbert Gladstone</span> undertaken to answer
question. I know these young Ministers; sure to pooh-pooh
question. So, being an old soldier, prepared counter-movement;
got handful of locusts; clapped 'em into box; brought 'em down,
intending to hand box over to <span class="sc">Herbert</span>. They seem, however, to
have anticipated proceedings. Prized lid off box, and swarmed all
about; looking for wild honey, I suppose. Hope they won't catch
<span class="sc">Speaker's</span> eye. Lend us a hand to net a few before they attack
<span class="sc">Hanbury</span>."</p>

<p>If Session goes on much longer will get itself counted out.
Members falling around us like leaves in wintry weather. <span class="sc">Prince
Arthur</span> not yet back; <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> off to sunnier climes; <span class="sc">John
Morley</span>, out too soon after approach to convalescence, gone to break
the bank at Monte Carlo; not likely to be seen here again this side
of Christmas. And now <span class="sc">Bobby Spencer</span> down; fallen on the field of
battle. Came into lobby just now at usual brisk pace; made his way
to Whip's room; drooped on threshhold. Happily nothing serious;
only a passing faint; but eloquent of strain upon Members in
these times. For <span class="sc">Bobby</span>, of course, the weight is exceptionally
heavy. <i>Nous autres</i> come and go; make holiday when we can get
a pair; as often as we have the heart to do so meet with light
negative <span class="sc">Bobby's</span> touching appeal, "You dine here to-night?"
But for him, always on the spot, his young head full of State cares,
his manly bosom enfolding innumerable State secrets, it is
different. Now the long pending blow suddenly falls, and <span class="sc">Bobby</span>,
not without reminiscence of the elder <span class="sc">Pitt</span> in an earlier Parliament,
fails at his post&mdash;"Young <span class="sc">Lycidas</span> and hath not left his peer."</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more,</p>
<p>Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere,</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Since Parish Councils Bill went into Committee,
Mr. G. has been silent in I don't know how many languages. It is
highest compliment to Minister in charge of a Bill that his Leader
should find it possible not only to refrain from taking part in debate,
but habitually to absent himself through long periods of a sitting.
<span class="sc">Henry Fowler</span> has earned this distinction. His management of
intricate measure has been excellent; conciliating Opposition without
causing revolt in sensitive ranks on own side. His Parliamentary
position distinctly advanced.</p>

<p>To-night Mr. G. drawn into fray. It was <span class="sc">Jokim</span> who did it. At
opening of sitting <span class="sc">Fowler</span> resisted Amendment by <span class="sc">Strachey</span>
making it permissible to transfer parochial trusts to management of
Parish Council. After nearly two hours' debate, <span class="sc">Rigby</span> put up
to say that Amendment on same lines standing further down, in
name of the contumacious <span class="sc">Cobb</span>, would be accepted. "A put-up
job!" cried <span class="sc">Goschen</span>, sternly eyeing the irreproachable <span class="sc">Rigby</span>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/288a-800.png"><img src="images/288a-300.png" width="300" height="270" alt="'A put-up job!'" /></a>
<p class="center">"A put-up job!"</p></div>

<p>This too much for Mr. G. Sat bolt upright from recumbent
position in which he had listened to debate. His eyes blazed; a
Jovelike frown clouded his brow; his hands moved restlessly, as,
leaning a little forward in attitude to spring, he waited till the unconscious
<span class="sc">Jokim</span>, blinking at other side of table, should sit down.
Spoke for only ten minutes; his energy supernal; his voice, long
unused, magnificent. "A put-up job!" he repeated in scornful
tones, with sweeping gesture of the arm. Drew graphic picture
of Editors of new Dictionary coming upon this phrase in Parliamentary
Report citing it, as thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Job</span>, a put-up." (<i>The Right Hon. J. Goschen, M.P.</i>)</p>

<p>Young Bloods behind Front Opposition Bench in historic corner,
whose recesses <span class="sc">Mellor's</span> glance cannot penetrate, didn't like this.
"Question! Question!" they roared. "It is a very interesting
question," said Mr. G., ready for a tussle with them if they insisted.
Pretty to see <span class="sc">Jokim</span> turn round and rebuke the Young Bloods on
back Benches. He was the object of attack; on his head the vials
of bubbling wrath overflowed. But <span class="sc">Jokim</span> has not lived in House of
Commons all these years without its traditions of high courtesy and
respect due to age and position being ingrained. He was shocked to
hear speech of Leader of House broken in upon with noisy cries of
"Question!" and, though they came from his own camp-followers,
he did not hesitate to administer sharp rebuke. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Got
into fresh tight place with Parish Councils Bill.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Quite lively to-night. Merriest evening since Home-Rule
Bill left us. Began with <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>. <span class="sc">Gorst</span>, who
is thinking of leaving his property to found almshouses for pious
ex-Solicitor-Generals, is alarmed at probable operation of this Bill.
His prophetic eye sees time when Parish Council of the future
will step in, snap its fingers at him (the Pious Founder); will
probably introduce Conscience Clause in matutinal exercises of aged
ex-Solicitor-Generals. <span class="sc">Gorst</span> draws up case on back of Orders;
presents it in form of conundrum. <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> hugely
contemptuous. Nothing easier than to draw up trust deed in form
that should obviate catastrophe foreseen by <span class="sc">Gorst's</span> fervid fancy.</p>

<p>"Just as easy," he says, "as a boy drawing an animal writes
over it 'This is a lion.' You draw your trust; write 'This is an
Ecclesiastical Charity,' and there you are. It will be out of purview
of the Act."</p>

<p>This would have been all very well if <span class="sc">Jesse Collings</span> had not
chanced to be among audience. Members evidently carried away
by <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood's</span> sophistry. <span class="sc">Jesse</span> pulled them up.</p>

<p>"Supposing," he said, looking unutterably wise, "the boy draws
an animal; writes over it, 'This is a lion,' and it turns out to be an
elephant. Where are you then?"</p>

<p>House really didn't know; positively staggered. "Just like one of
those questions the <i>Carpenter</i> in 'Through the Looking Glass' used
to ask <i>Alice</i>," said <span class="sc">George Curzon</span>. "Floors everybody." Instead
of sitting down and bravely facing difficulty suggested by <span class="sc">Jesse's</span>
active mind, Members, catching sight of <span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span> contemplating
nature from Treasury Bench, with one accord turned
upon him. Cries of "<span class="sc">Rigby!</span> <span class="sc">Rigby!</span>" filled Chamber. Everything
forgotten in excitement of this new chase. The lion lay
down with the elephant, and the <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> led
them. <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, back after a bout of influenza, joined in
chase with boyish energy. <span class="sc">Henry James</span> and <span class="sc">Joseph</span> answered
from opposite camp. <span class="sc">J. G. Talbot</span> delivered what, judging from
his manner, was a funeral sermon over departed but anonymous
friend; only a sentence heard here and there amid the uproar.
<span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span> sat silent, with no other sign of consciousness
than an occasional benevolent shaking of the head when the cry of
"<span class="sc">Rigby!</span> <span class="sc">Rigby!</span>" rose to stormier heights.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/288b-800.png"><img src="images/288b-300.png" width="300" height="281" alt="Baiting the Solicitor-General." /></a>
<p class="center">Baiting the Solicitor-General.</p></div>

<p>At length <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> moved to report progress. With this
pistol at his head, <span class="sc">Rigby</span> rose, and proceeded in his inimitable
manner to deliver an opinion on the case. When lo! the strangest
thing of all happened. Members on Opposition benches, who had
made themselves hoarse in clamouring for <span class="sc">Rigby</span>, now when he
coyly yielded to their flattering insistence on his stating his views,
hurriedly left the House. But they'd had their joke, a joke two
hours long. Were not going to have it spoiled by an anti-climax.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;None; but a merry night withal.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;More about Charities as affected by Parish Councils
Bill. Opposition got their back up. They love the Bill more than
ever; but they will not let it pass. A great deal said about charity;
but there's no lovingkindness. Encouraged by hunt of last night
turn again upon <span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span>. A thirst for information.
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> insinuatingly suggests that House would be happy
if <span class="sc">Rigby</span> would only give his views as to the precise meaning of
phrase "parochial charities." <span class="sc">Rigby</span> affects not to hear. Diligently
makes notes on his brief with preoccupied air. <span class="sc">Joseph</span> runs
in from behind and pulls the hair of his right hon. friend the
<span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>. The <span class="sc">Squire</span>, nothing loath, lets fly from the
shoulder. Rumpus; somebody moves Closure; Chairman takes no
notice; at end of two hours Committee divide. Coming back, approach
identical question from slightly different point of view; talk round
it for another two hours. At twelve o'clock we go home with uneasy
feeling that for all practical purposes, as far as progress of Bill is
concerned, we might as well have stopped there. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;None.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p><span class="sc">Erratic.</span>&mdash;There was an odd-looking misprint in <i>Le Figaro</i> for
Wednesday last of an "r" for an "i," so that what was intended
for "la Cour d'assises à Old Bailey" read "la Cour d'assises à

be pleased to find himself famous in French.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
